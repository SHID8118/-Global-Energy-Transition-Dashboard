    - This plot shows the relationship between **renewable energy share** and **fossil fuel consumption** for {latest_year}.
    - Countries with a **higher share of renewables** often tend to have **lower absolute fossil fuel usage**, but not always.
    - Some high fossil-consuming countries are still making progress on increasing their renewables share.
